## 🎮 What is Mage Arena Mod Menu?

It's a dynamic in-game overlay that gives you full control of the game’s mechanics. Once injected, you’ll get a slick interface with toggles and sliders for cheats, player stats, environmental settings, and more. It works live—meaning you can activate godmode mid-fight or spawn loot in the middle of a boss arena.

The mod menu is lightweight, undetectable (for offline/singleplayer use), and stacked with OP features. Say goodbye to dying, farming, or waiting for cooldowns. Say hello to wizard domination. 💀✨
